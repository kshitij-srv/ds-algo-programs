# DSA Programs

Crucial DSA programs to demonstrate solutions w.r.t. various topics in DSA.

- Topics have been segregated by folder names.
- Each folder comprises of solutions to topic-related programs.

**Note:**

1. > For feasibility of running these programs in VScode and due to VS Codes launch config's limitations(to support only absolute paths), a `bin` folder might be found inside the `src` folder for sake of debugging. This `bin` folder is automatically generated when running a java file in the repo and is used to run the code automatically from the VScode debugger. See `task.json` and `launch.json` for details.

2. > A `bin` folder that is found alongside the `src` folder has been compiled manually
